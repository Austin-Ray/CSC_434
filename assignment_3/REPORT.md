This program consists of six SML files, which build up to complete the
assignment.

In order to keep code reuse to a minimum, each part imports the previous using
the "use" statement.

Unfortunately, that requires the `sml` command to be run within the `src`
folder. Otherwise, the interpreter will fail to import the necessary files.

Language constructs used:
-------------------------
 - Lists
 - Pattern-matching
 - Augmenting recursive functions
 - Tail-recursive functions (to demonstrate a superior merge_pass)
 - If ... Then ... Else
 - Let ... In ... End
