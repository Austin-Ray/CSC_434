For assignment #1, the programs utilized integers and real data types,
read(*,*) and write(*,*) statements, do loops, comments, string formats,
arrays, and functions to achieve the assignment statements.

These are standard language features that one comes to expect from a
language so there was no thought to why one should these features, with
the exception of functions. The functions are minimal and fit in the do
loop; however, the usage of functions is explicit in the instructions,
thus their inclusion.
