### Language features used:
 * Types/Categories
 * If-Then-Else statements
 * Functions
 * I/O
 * Logical negation

### Questions
 1. Q) For what types of problems is Prolog well suited (i.e. what is easy to do
       in Prolog)

    A) Prolog is suited for: "formal logic and associated forms of programming,
       reasoning modeling, database programming, programming, and so on." [0]

 2. Q) Would these things be easy or hard to do in your favorite language. What
       would it take to do these in your favorite language.

    A) My favorite language is Kotlin.
       In Kotlin, it would be hard to do the tasks that Prolog is suited for.
       This is because Kotlin is an object-oriented language with functional
       aspects. Kotlin is an incremental improvement upon Java. Additionally,
       Kotlin is limited by the JVM, which makes the logic paradigm harder to
       implement.
